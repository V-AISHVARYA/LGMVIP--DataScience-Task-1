**IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT**  
ðŸŒ± Welcome to my repository, a chronicle of my maiden voyage into the realm of data science through my captivating internship at LetsGrowMore. Join me in uncovering the secrets of the Iris dataset and the captivating art of classification.

**Project Overview**   
In this internship, I focused on the Iris dataset, a renowned dataset in the field of machine learning and data science. The Iris dataset comprises samples of three different species of iris flowers, each having four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. My main objective was to create a classification model that could accurately distinguish between these three species based on these features.  
INPUT:Features of flowers  (Data in the form of comma separated value file-Iris.csv)  
OUTPUT:Class of flower  

**Key Tasks**  
Data Collection  
Data Exploration  
Data Preprocessing  
Exploratory data analysis  
Model Selection  
Model Training  
Model Evaluvation  
Documentation  

**Reflection**  
My first data science internship at LetsGrowMore provided me with a solid foundation in tackling real-world datasets, preprocessing techniques, and building classification models. The experience has been both educational and rewarding, and I'm excited to continue honing my skills in the field of data science.

Feel free to explore this repository to understand the journey I undertook in mastering the Iris dataset classification. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated!
